# How We Roll at Loop

**Moving fast but thoughtfully** - We embrace startup speed but make decisions with care

**Radical transparency** - We share information openly and communicate directly

**Customer obsession** - We're deeply connected to the businesses we serve

**Continuous improvement** - We're never satisfied with the status quo

<!--
**Speaker Notes - Company Values:**

- Make the values relevant to the technical topic: "Our values directly shaped how we approached our payment infrastructure challenge."

- Connect to technical decisions: "Moving fast but thoughtfully meant finding a solution that would let us ship quickly but with reliability guarantees."

- Highlight the transparency angle: "Radical transparency guided us to build systems with complete visibility into every transaction step."

- Link to customer impact: "Our customer obsession meant that reliability wasn't optional - businesses depend on our payments going through correctly every time."

- Connect to Temporal: "These values led us to adopt Temporal, which we'll explore in detail shortly."

- Time target: About 30-45 seconds - keep this brief, but connect values to your technical solution
