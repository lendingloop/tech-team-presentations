# The Loop Tech Team

A lean (but mighty!) team of ~10 engineers building global financial infrastructure

**Full-Stack Engineers**: Building seamless experiences across our platform

**Payment Backend Specialists**: Ensuring reliability and compliance

**Frontend Experts**: Creating intuitive user interfaces

**Senior Technical Leaders**: Guiding architecture and best practices


<!--
**Speaker Notes - Team Context:**

- Keep this slide brief: "Let me quickly introduce our team before diving into the technical challenges we faced."

- Emphasize the technical culture: "Despite being small, our team brings deep payment expertise - many of us have worked at major banks and payment processors before."

- Connect team structure to the technical challenge: "Our payment backend specialists were the ones who identified the need for a more reliable workflow engine for our payment processing."

- Mention the hands-on approach: "As a lean team, we can't afford complex solutions that require dedicated teams to maintain. What we build needs to be reliable but also maintainable by a small team."

- Transition hook: "This is why finding the right architecture for our payment processing was so critical."

- Time target: About 45 seconds - this slide provides context but isn't the main focus
