# Why Payments Are Complicated

### Technical Challenges

- 🔄 **Multiple Systems Working Together**: Like an orchestra where every instrument must play perfectly in sync

- ⏱️ **Time-Sensitive Processes**: Some steps happen in milliseconds, others take days to complete

- ❌ **Handling Failures**: If one step breaks, we need to safely undo everything or fix it

- 🔎 **Complete Tracking Required**: Every cent must be accounted for at every moment

- 💰 **No Double-Charging**: Systems must ensure money is never moved twice by mistake

- 🌐 **Currency Complications**: Adding different currencies multiplies the complexity


<!--
**Why Payments Are Hard:**
- Payments seem simple on the surface - money moves from A to B
- But in reality, they're one of the hardest distributed systems problems
- Each payment touches 5+ services, each with their own failure modes
- Add multi-currency and it gets even more complex

**The Multi-Step Process:**
- Authorization: Can this card be charged? Is it valid?
- Reserve funds: Hold the money but don't move it yet
- Process payment: Actually move the money
- Update ledgers: Record the transaction in accounting systems
- Notify systems: Tell everyone the payment happened
- Each step can fail independently

**Cross-Border Complexity:**
- With traditional systems, you need to manage currency conversion
- Exchange rates fluctuate by the second
- Settlement times vary by currency pair
- Compliance requirements differ by country
- Reconciliation becomes exponentially more complex

**The Reliability Challenge:**
- For payments, five nines (99.999%) reliability is the minimum acceptable
- That's just 5 minutes of downtime per year
- With ~20 API calls per transaction, we need systems that can recover from failures
- Every failed payment needs perfect compensation - leaving money in limbo is not an option
