**Speaker Notes:**

Why This Matters:
Canada does $965 billion in cross-border trade annually. Think about every Canadian business dealing with:
- Tech companies paying for US SaaS
- E-commerce selling cross-border
- Professional services with global clients

The Scale:
We're not just building another credit card. We're building financial infrastructure that lets Canadian businesses compete globally without bleeding money on FX.

Additional Speaker Notes:
- Use specific, relatable examples (AWS, Stripe)
- Highlight the unfair advantages bigger companies have
- Emphasize the wasted time/money/complexity of manual reconciliation
- Use the $965B number for impact
- Position as infrastructure, not just a product
