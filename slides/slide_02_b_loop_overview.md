**Speaker Notes - Product Context:**

- Opening line: "Our product suite addresses a critical problem for Canadian businesses - managing global money flows efficiently."

- Use a concrete example: "When a Canadian startup pays for AWS in USD, Stripe in USD, and hires contractors in Europe, they're typically losing 3% on every transaction. That adds up to tens of thousands per year."

- Connect to technical complexity: "Each of these solutions requires orchestrating multi-step payment flows across different banking systems. This is where our technical challenge begins."

- Emphasize the impact: "Canada does $965 billion in cross-border trade annually. The technical solution I'm about to show you impacts businesses across the entire economy."

- Transition to technical focus: "Now let's look at what makes these payment flows so technically challenging to implement reliably."

- Time target: About 75 seconds - provide enough context but move quickly to the technical content
