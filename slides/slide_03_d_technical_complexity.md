# Why Payments Are Complicated

#### The Perfect World Solution Would Need To:

- Coordinate all steps perfectly
- Automatically fix any failures
- Track every action
- Work across different currencies

#### What We Needed to Solve This:

- A reliable system for maintaining complete transaction integrity
- Smart handling of failures at any step
- Full visibility into what's happening at each moment
- Technology that would grow with our business


<!--
**Why Payments Are Hard:**
- Payments seem simple on the surface - money moves from A to B
- But in reality, they're one of the hardest distributed systems problems
- Each payment touches 5+ services, each with their own failure modes
- Add multi-currency and it gets even more complex

**The Multi-Step Process:**
- Authorization: Can this card be charged? Is it valid?
- Reserve funds: Hold the money but don't move it yet
- Process payment: Actually move the money
- Update ledgers: Record the transaction in accounting systems
- Notify systems: Tell everyone the payment happened
- Each step can fail independently

**Cross-Border Complexity:**
- With traditional systems, you need to manage currency conversion
- Exchange rates fluctuate by the second
- Settlement times vary by currency pair
- Compliance requirements differ by country
- Reconciliation becomes exponentially more complex

**The Reliability Challenge:**
- For payments, five nines (99.999%) reliability is the minimum acceptable
- That's just 5 minutes of downtime per year
- With ~20 API calls per transaction, we need systems that can recover from failures
- Every failed payment needs perfect compensation - leaving money in limbo is not an option
