<!--
**Speaker Notes - Company Context:**

- Set the business context: "Before diving into the technical details, let me explain the business problem we're solving."

- Highlight the payment complexity: "Loop helps Canadian businesses manage global payments without the typical foreign exchange fees. This means we're handling multi-currency transactions that need to settle across different banking systems."

- Connect to technical challenge: "What sounds simple on a slide - 'no FX fees' - actually requires complex transaction orchestration across multiple banking partners and currencies."

- Emphasize the scale: "We're processing millions in transactions monthly, so reliability isn't optional - it's existential for our business."

- Keep this brief (about 60 seconds) - the audience is here for the technical content, but needs this context to understand why the solution matters.
