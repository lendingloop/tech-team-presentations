# Our Hard-Earned Wisdom

#### So You Don't Have to Learn the Hard Way

| **What Worked Like a Charm** | **What We'd Do Differently** |
|---|---|
| Start with simple workflows | More upfront team training |
| Local dev environment focus | Better monitoring from day one |
| Temporal Cloud > self-hosted | Document patterns earlier |
| Testing with Temporal SDK | More gradual service migration |

> **The Bottom Line**: Yes, there's a learning curve, but it's like learning to ride a bikeâ€”painful at first, then you wonder how you ever lived without it.
