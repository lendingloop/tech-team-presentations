🍁 Back to Ruby... after a traumatic experience

❤️ Obsessed by delivering customer value

👥 Building teams that ship reliable, impactful systems

<!--
**Speaker Notes - Personal Introduction:**

- Start light: "After a 5-year break from Ruby, I'm back in the ecosystem and excited to share what we're building at Loop"

- Expand briefly on your fintech experience: "I've spent over a decade working with payment systems, from traditional banking APIs to blockchain payment networks"

- Share a quick pain point that led to Temporal: "Before implementing Temporal, we had a $47K payment stuck in limbo for 3 days because a background job failed silently. That's the kind of problem we've eliminated."

- Connect with audience: "Many of you have probably faced similar reliability challenges in your systems. Today I'll show you how we solved them."

- Time target: Keep this slide to about 60-90 seconds, focus on building connection rather than listing credentials

**Key Message:**
Show that you're someone who has faced the same problems as the audience and found a solution worth sharing.

## Timing: 60 seconds
