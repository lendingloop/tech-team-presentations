**Speaker Notes - Join Our Team:**

- Start with enthusiasm: "Before we wrap up completely, I wanted to mention that we're growing our team at Loop, and we're looking for passionate engineers who are excited about solving hard problems in fintech."

- Share the technical opportunity:
  * "If what I've described today sounds interesting, we have a lot more challenges like this that we're tackling."
  * "Beyond Temporal workflows, we work with Ruby on Rails, React, PostgreSQL, and AWS infrastructure. We're also exploring event sourcing patterns and building our own financial ledger systems."
  * "We're a small team, which means you get to work across the stack and have meaningful input on technical decisions."

- Describe the business impact:
  * "Loop is building modern financial infrastructure for Canadian businesses. Our payment and card issuing platform helps companies manage cash flow, automate payments, and scale their operations."
  * "What makes this exciting is that we're solving real problems for real businesses - the tools we build directly impact their ability to grow and succeed."
  * "For engineers, this means your work has immediate, visible impact on customers every day."

- Talk about the team culture:
  * "Our engineering culture values thoughtful system design, collaboration, and sustainable pace. We're not about heroics or burnout - we're building for the long term."
  * "We value learning and experimentation. Many of the Temporal patterns I showed today evolved through team discussions and iteration."
  * "We also prioritize work-life balance. Those 3 AM pages I mentioned? They used to happen regularly. With Temporal, they're now extremely rare."

- Mention specific opportunities:
  * "We're currently looking for backend engineers with Ruby experience, as well as full-stack developers comfortable working across our systems."
  * "Experience with workflow orchestration or payment systems is a plus, but not required. Curiosity and willingness to learn are much more important."

- Close with an invitation:
  * "If this sounds interesting, I'd love to chat more after the presentation. Or feel free to email me directly - my address is on the screen."
  * "Even if you're not looking to make a move right now, I'm always happy to talk shop about Temporal, payments, or distributed systems challenges."

- Time target: 1 minute - keep it brief but enthusiastic
