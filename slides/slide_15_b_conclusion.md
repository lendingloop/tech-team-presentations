**Speaker Notes - Conclusion:**

- Start with the value proposition: "So, if you're tired of getting paged at 3 AM for stuck payments or explaining to customers why their money is in limbo, Temporal might be the solution you're looking for."

- Provide a concrete path forward:
  * "If you're interested in exploring Temporal for your own systems, here's how I recommend getting started."
  * "First, visit temporal.io/docs - the official documentation is comprehensive and includes excellent getting started guides and tutorials."
  * "For Ruby developers, the Ruby SDK at github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby is your best friend. The README includes installation instructions and simple example workflows to get you started."
  * "The SDK is extremely well-documented and the examples cover common patterns like the saga pattern we discussed today."

- Share additional resources:
  * "Our presentation slides and code examples are available in our public GitHub repository. Feel free to use these as reference for your own implementation."
  * "The Temporal community is also incredibly helpful. Join the Slack channel mentioned in the docs - it's where you can get help from Temporal creators and experienced users."

- Offer personal guidance:
  * "If you have specific questions about how we implemented Temporal at Loop or want to discuss whether it might be a good fit for your use case, please reach out to me directly."
  * "My email is on the screen, and I'm happy to share more details about our journey, including specific patterns we've implemented and challenges we've overcome."

- End with the key takeaway: "The bottom line is that Temporal fundamentally changed how we think about distributed systems reliability. What used to be our most stressful, complex code is now our most reliable and maintainable. It's rare that a technology delivers that kind of transformational impact, but Temporal absolutely did for us."

- Final thought: "Thank you for your attention today. I hope you found this useful, and I look forward to your questions."
