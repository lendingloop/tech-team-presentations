# Sidekiq vs. Temporal: Why It Matters

#### When Task2 Fails: Two Different Worlds

| **Sidekiq** | **Temporal** |
|---|---|
| ❌ Retries the individual job | ✅ Remembers the entire workflow context |
| ❌ Loses progress if worker crashes | ✅ Continues from exact failure point |
| ❌ No built-in workflow visibility | ✅ Full history and state inspection |
| ❌ Manual compensation for partial failures | ✅ Automated compensation patterns |

> **Real-World Impact**: When a payment capture failed with Sidekiq, we often had to manually reconcile accounts. With Temporal, the system automatically handles failure and continues the transaction exactly where it left off.

Image Prompt for Eraser:

Create a side-by-side comparison diagram showing two workflows processing a payment transaction. 

Left side labeled "SIDEKIQ": Show 5 connected boxes in a workflow (Account Check → FX Rate → Compliance → Capture → Settle) with the middle box (Compliance) colored red with an X. Below it, show a "retry" arrow going back just to that box, with a small explosion icon and text "State lost between retries".

Right side labeled "TEMPORAL": Show the same 5 connected boxes, with Compliance also marked with an X, but show a "retry" arrow that maintains a connection to a "Workflow History" database below. Include text "Continues with full context".

Use professional fintech-style graphics with a clean, modern look suitable for a business presentation.

**Speaker Notes - Direct Comparison:**

- Start with the side-by-side approach: "Let me break down why the architectural differences between Sidekiq and Temporal matter so much for payment reliability. This table highlights four key differences that directly affected our business."

- For remembering workflow context:
  * "In Sidekiq, each job is isolated - it doesn't know about the other jobs in your workflow"
  * "Example: When processing a currency exchange, if the final settlement job fails, the new job has no idea that we already checked compliance and captured funds"
  * "With Temporal, the entire workflow context is preserved - when a retry happens, all previous steps and their data are still accessible"

- For continuing after crashes:
  * "This is a crucial difference for payment systems - if a Sidekiq worker crashes mid-execution, the progress is gone"
  * "Real case: During a Redis outage, we had dozens of currency exchanges where the source was debited but the destination credit failed. When systems recovered, we had to manually identify and complete these transactions."
  * "With Temporal, if a worker crashes, when a new worker comes online, it picks up exactly where the previous one left off - not from the beginning, not from some arbitrary checkpoint"

- For workflow visibility:
  * "With Sidekiq, tracking a payment across multiple jobs required custom logging, database queries, and often guesswork"
  * "Show the audience: With Temporal, we can see the entire payment journey in one place - which steps completed, which failed, which are pending - all in real-time"
  * "This visibility has cut our troubleshooting time from hours to minutes"

- For automated compensation:
  * "When things failed with Sidekiq, we had to manually write scripts to detect and fix partial transfers"
  * "With Temporal, we define compensation workflows once - if a later step fails, we can automatically trigger cleanup activities like refunds"
  * "This has virtually eliminated the risk of money getting stuck in an intermediate state"

- End with the business impact: "To put this in perspective: Before Temporal, our team was spending approximately 15 hours per week handling payment failures manually. After Temporal, this dropped to less than 1 hour per week - freeing our team to build new features instead of fighting fires."

- Time target: 90 seconds - this is a crucial comparison slide that bridges the problem and solution
