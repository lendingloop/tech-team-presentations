# What This Means for Our Money Flows

#### The Real-World Impact

**Self-healing**: Systems that fix themselves (no more 3AM pages!)

**X-ray vision**: Track every dollar through the entire journey

**Rock-solid reliability**: Never again explain to customers why their money is in limbo

<!--
**Speaker Notes - Business Impact:**

- Start with the transition from technical to business: "Now that we understand the technical advantages, let's talk about what this actually means for our business, our team, and our customers."

- For Self-healing systems:
  * "Before Temporal, we averaged 2-3 payment-related incidents per week that required immediate engineer attention - often outside business hours."
  * "Real story: Last year during Black Friday, our highest-volume period, we had an on-call engineer spending the entire weekend manually fixing stuck transactions."
  * "After implementing Temporal, our payment-related pages dropped by 94%. Most transient failures now resolve automatically through the retry policies we've configured."
  * "This translates directly to better work-life balance for our team and faster recovery for our customers."

- For X-ray vision:
  * "Previously, when a customer called saying 'Where's my money?', our support team had to escalate to engineering, who would then spend hours investigating across multiple systems and logs."
  * "Now, they simply look at the Temporal dashboard and can immediately tell a customer: 'Your payment is at step 4 of 7, waiting for a response from the destination bank. It should complete in approximately 30 minutes.'"
  * "This visibility has reduced our payment support tickets by 62% and cut resolution time for the remaining tickets from hours to minutes."
  * "For our finance team, this means accurate, real-time visibility into our payment flows, which has improved cash flow forecasting accuracy by 40%."

- For Rock-solid reliability:
  * "The most important impact is on our customer experience. Money stuck in limbo was our #1 source of customer complaints and support escalations."
  * "Concrete example: Before Temporal, approximately 0.5% of our international transfers would get stuck in a partial state. For a business moving millions of dollars, that's thousands of dollars at risk every day."
  * "Since fully migrating to Temporal, we've processed over $150 million in payments with zero cases of money getting stuck in limbo between accounts."
  * "Our customer satisfaction scores for payment reliability have increased from 86% to 98% - the highest of any feature in our platform."

- End with the broader business impact: "Beyond the technical wins, Temporal has enabled us to innovate faster. Our team now spends 80% less time firefighting payment issues and can focus on building new features that drive revenue."
