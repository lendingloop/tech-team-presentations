# What This Means for Our Money Flows

#### The Real-World Impact

**Self-healing**: Systems that fix themselves (no more 3AM pages!)

**X-ray vision**: Track every dollar through the entire journey

**Rock-solid reliability**: Never again explain to customers why their money is in limbo

<!--
**Explaining the Architecture:**
- Temporal has a unique architecture that preserves workflow state even when workers fail
- The Temporal server acts as the "brain" - storing workflow state and history
- Workers are stateless and can be restarted at any time
- This provides durability that's impossible with traditional job processors

**Key Advantages Visualized:**
- In traditional architecture: If a worker processing a payment dies mid-transaction, you lose state
- With Temporal: The workflow continues exactly where it left off when a new worker starts
- This is what makes it so powerful for payment processing - we get true durability for free

**The Timeline View:**
- Each workflow execution is recorded as an immutable history of events
- Activities can be executed sequentially or in parallel
- Failed activities are automatically retried based on configurable policies
- The entire execution history is queryable and visible in the Temporal UI

**Technical Note:**
- The charts show how Temporal's "event sourcing" approach is fundamentally different
- Rather than storing current state, it records the full history of events
- This allows for time-travel debugging and complete auditability
