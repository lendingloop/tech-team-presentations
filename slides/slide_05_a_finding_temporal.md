# Finding the Right Workflow Solution

## Our Key Requirements

✓ **Reliable Coordination**: Manage communication across multiple services

✓ **Automatic Recovery**: Fix problems when steps fail

✓ **Complete Visibility**: See exactly what's happening at each step

✓ **Strong Consistency**: Guarantee data accuracy throughout the process

✓ **Ruby Integration**: Work with our existing Ruby codebase

✓ **Manageable Complexity**: Not require a huge operational team

<!--
**The Mandate:**
After Q4's $47k loss incident, our CTO gave us a clear mandate: find a solution that guarantees workflow reliability. We had 3 weeks to research and recommend.

**What We Evaluated:**
We looked at several options:

**AWS Step Functions:** Great if you're all-in on AWS, but we're multi-cloud and local development was painful.

**Apache Airflow:** Built for batch ETL workflows, not real-time payment processing.

**Cadence:** The predecessor to Temporal, but operational complexity was too high for our team size.

**Custom Solution:** We sketched out building our own orchestrator. Would take 6+ months and we'd be maintaining complex distributed systems code instead of focusing on payments.

**Why Temporal Won:**
Temporal kept coming up in our research. Three things sold us:

1. Production-ready Ruby SDK. We could start building immediately without rewriting existing services.
2. Time-travel debugging. When workflows fail, you can see exactly what happened at every step. No more log archaeology.
3. Automatic compensation. Temporal can automatically undo completed steps when later steps fail. This directly solved our partial failure problem.

**Social Proof:**
Plus, companies like Uber, Netflix, and Stripe use Temporal for similar workflows. If it's good enough for Stripe's payment processing...

**The Proof of Concept:**
We ran a 2-week POC migrating our simplest payment flow. Results were immediate:
- Zero partial failures during testing
- Complete workflow visibility  
- Developers actually enjoyed working with it
- Easy local development and testing
