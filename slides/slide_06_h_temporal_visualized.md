# Advanced Temporal Features

#### Beyond Just Reliability

| **Feature** | **Real-World Benefit** |
|---|---|
| **Signals & Queries** | Interact with running workflows (e.g., cancel a payment mid-flow) |
| **Child Workflows** | Compose complex processes from simpler building blocks |
| **Saga Patterns** | Automatic compensation when things go wrong (built-in rollback) |
| **Versioning** | Deploy changes without disrupting in-flight workflows |
| **Cron Workflows** | Scheduled execution with failure guarantees (unlike cron jobs) |
