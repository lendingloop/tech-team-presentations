# The Promise of Bulletproof Payments

## Our Journey to Ruby + Temporal Workflows

<div class="text-center pt-10 italic text-orange-400">
  "From current reality to payment (confidence)"
</div>

<!--
**Opening:**
Hi everyone, I'm [Your Name]. I've been writing Ruby for 15 years, and like many of you, I've had a love-hate relationship with this language and ecosystem.
**Personal Connection:**
Two months ago I had my first day at Loop Card. Guess what my onboarding task was? `bundle install`. Same errors I've been seeing for 15 years. Some things never change.
But here's what has changed: how we think about building reliable distributed systems. Today I want to share how we're using Temporal.io to solve real problems in Canadian fintech.
**What You'll Learn:**
In the next 30 minutes, I'll show you:
- What Loop Card is building and why it matters for Canadian businesses
- The technical challenges of multi-currency payment processing
- How Temporal workflows transformed our architecture
- Real code, real numbers, and live demonstrations

This isn't theoretical. Everything I'll show you is running in production, processing real money for real Canadian businesses. No toy examples, no contrived demos.

- Start with bundle install joke - universal Ruby developer experience
- Establish credibility (15 years experience) but stay humble
- Set clear expectations for the talk
- Emphasize practical, real-world focus
- Build anticipation for what's coming

## Timing: 90 seconds
